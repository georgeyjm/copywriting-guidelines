# Yearbook Copywriting Requirements

## English

### Punctuation

1. Use a single ellipsis (…) rather than triple periods (...)

2. Do not use double ellipses (……)

3. Use hyphens, en-dashes and em-dashes correctly
    - **Hyphens (-)** are used when joining multiple words, separate syllables (including line breaks) or in a hyphenated name
      > e.g. sugar-free; em-dash; 24-year-old; Mis-sis-si-ppi; Olivia Newton-John
  
    - **En-dashes (–)** are used to connect values in a range or that are related
      > e.g. 2017–2018; used 20–30 minutes; scored 98–95
  
    - **Em-dashes (—)** are used to separate phrases or words in a sentence or to indicate an unfinished sentence
      > e.g. Peter—the only man—won; school is based on the three R’s—reading, writing, and ’rithmetic; something I've not felt since—

4. Use smart quotes (“” and ‘’) instead of dumb quotes ("" and ''), same applies to apostrophes (’)

5. Use primes (′″‴) to express numeric values when necessary
    > e.g. 6′4″; 30°44′54″
    
6. Place commas and periods before a closing quotation mark

7. Although in most cases, single quotes and double quotes are used interchangeably, for the sake of uniformity, use double quotes when quoting a word, a phrase or a dialogue

8. Do not use repeated punctuations
    > e.g. **NOT** it is awesome!!!; but why???

### Spacing

1. No spaces before and after hyphens, en-dashes and em-dashes

2. No spaces before and after ellipsis

3. Single space after normal punctuations like periods, commas, exclamation marks, question marks, quotation marks, etc.. **Except** do not leave any spaces after the *last* punctuation mark in a paragraph

4. Add a space between a numerical value and its unit (expect degrees and percentages), however, it is best to use
    > e.g. length is 30 m; capacity of 50 GB; used up 50% of memory; reached a temperature of 30℃


## 中文

1. 使用全角标点（例如。，：；——）而非半角标点（例如.,:;—），但是在插入英文词组或特殊名词时，其内容内使用半角标点
    > 例：乔布斯曾经说过：“Stay hungry, stay foolish.”

2. 不使用直角引号（『』「」）

3. 不使用重复标点
    > 例：**不要：** 非常棒！！！为什么？！？！

4. 在中文（包括全角标点）与英文之间不要加空格，且将中文之间的英文首字母大写
    > 例：名叫John Williams的同学；感谢所有的Prefects，

5. 在中文（包括全角标点）与数字之间不要加空格
    > 例：在2018年；获得了500元
